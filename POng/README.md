# Game-Dev

This is a simple Pong game written in C, created using the SDL2 Library for handling renders on different OS's such as Windows/MacOS/Linux.

The more time I spent programming, the more I realized that I had a keen interest in wanting to understand what goes on under the hood.
This motivated me to figure out writing a game in C (at the time, writing a game in Assembly did not cross my mind).

Using SDL2 gave me a good head-start at what I wanted to do, but it did not provide my curiosity the necessary satisfaction; after all, there were still things going on under the hood that SDL was taking care of (I didn't really like this aspect of abstraction that SDL2 provided).

Hopefully in the future, I will be writing at least a game or two in Assembly to fully understand what goes on when I want to write information on my video card for it to display it on the screen in time for the users to have a positive gaming experience.
Maybe inspecting John Carmack's code for Doom can be a start.
