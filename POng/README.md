# Game-Dev

This is a simple Pong game written in C, created using the SDL2 Library for handling renders on different OS's such as Windows/MacOS/Linux.

The more time I spent programming, the more I realized that I had a keen interest in wanting to understand what goes on under the hood.
This motivated me to figure out writing a game in C (at the time, writing on in Assembly didn't even cross my mind).

However, the deeper I stare into the abyss, alas the abyss stares back at me lol.

Using SDL2 gave me a good head-start at what I wanted to do, but did not provide my curiosity the necessary satisfaction; after all, there were still things going on under the hood that SDL was taking care of (I didn't really like this aspect).

Hopefully in the future, I would've written at least a game or two in Assembly to fully understand what goes on when I want to write information on my video card for it to display it on the screen in a short amount of time.
Maybe John Carmack can help.
